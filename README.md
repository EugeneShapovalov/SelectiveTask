SelectiveTask
=============

task for course.
I used IDEA 13 and jdk 1.7.0_51. Just build and start project.
Project classes: SelectiveTask - main, Downloader, XmlParser, ArtistEvent.
Project name must be SelectiveTask. You also need Internet to download data from "bandsintown.com".
Copy code from files in this repository to project classes with the same names.
